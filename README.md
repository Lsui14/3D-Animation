# 3D-Animation
This is an individual project where I created a 3D environment and a character from scratch, then I animated the character and the scenary using different techniques.

## Process:
0. **References**:  
   I started by searching for references to start de project.
1. **Concept Design**:  
   I continued by creating concepts for both the 3D scene and the character to establish the overall look and feel.
2. **Modeling**:   
   - Used **3ds Max** for character and environment modeling.
3. **Texturing**:  
   I handled the texturing process for both the environment and the character to bring them to life.
   - Used **Substance Painter** for character texturing.
4. **Animation**:  
   I handled the animation process for both the environment and the character to bring them to life.
   - Used **3ds Max** for all animations (CAT, controllers...).
4. **Export to Unity**:  
   I made the character playable. It can be controlled.
   - Used **Unity** as engine.

## Summary:
This project showcases my skills in **3D modeling**, **concept art**, **texturing**, **rigging** and **animation**.
